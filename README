random node.js project in coffeescript


dependencies:
	run 'npm install'
	coffee-script and supervisor should be installed manually with -g

how to run:
	make will compile everything
	make watch will spawn coffee watching processes to automatically build
	make start will start badmars via supervisor
	running make watch and then make start will automatically restart everything on file updates
	don't lose track of your coffeescript watch processes!

features:
	generates worlds and stores them in a db
	provides a REST api for accessing worlds

also included is a viewing client thing in ./client/
does not actually talk to server yet, just builds it's own
map.

another project is https://github.com/monofuel/badMars-Unreal
will be a viewer done in the unreal engine

TODO:
	setup javascript client to load map from server instead of generate one
	perhaps some sort of world chunk streaming system?
	console acts buggy with supervisor
	web console would be cool
	admin page would be cool
	https and account authentication
