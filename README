random node.js project in coffeescript

how to run:
  build the .coffee files with coffee -c *.coffee
  node badMars.js

dependencies:
  mongoose
  simplex-noise
  ws
  readline

features:
  generates worlds and stores them in a db

also included is a viewing client thing in ./client/
does not actually talk to server yet, just builds it's own
map.

TODO:
  setup client to load map from server instead of generate one
  perhaps some sort of world chunk streaming system?
