tech stack:
	backend:
		nodejs
		rethinkdb

	frontend:

current task:
	trying out kubernetes and becoming more microservice-y
	might be reasonable to do something about how mongo is half-assed setup for google oauth with japura.net
	polishing and bug fixing for v1.0
	cancel ghost feature

TODO:
	watch user table for changes and push updates
	dummy DB interface to allow testing modules in production without actually writing changes
	properly flowtype the entire codebase
	make sure that all writes do not clobber
	maybe a distributed locking system for unit movement?
	web console would be cool
	admin page would be cool
	work through TODOs in code and refactor things that I was too lazy to do properly the first time around
	work on documentation
	chat (client and server)
	SSAO lighting effects (client)
	better models (client)
	textures (client)
	color or flag system (client & server)
	lines between units showing how resources are being automatically delivered. (client)
	cancel ghost feature (server)
	trade routes (both client and server)
	have units actually use fuel
	time left for fuel usage on units
	music (epic guitar stuffs of course)
