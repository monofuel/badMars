webGL multiplayer rts game in development

dependencies:
	run 'npm install'
	coffee-script and supervisor should be installed manually with -g

how to run:
	make will compile everything
	make start will start badmars via supervisor

features:
	generates worlds and stores them in a db
	provides a REST api for accessing worlds

documentation:
	the badmars planet viewer is being documented with codo, documentation
	documentation is in public/js/badmars/docs
	currently no serious linting is being done (maybe I should use typescript instead, or facebook flow)

another potential project is https://github.com/monofuel/badMars-Unreal
will be a viewer done in the unreal engine. currently just experimenting with REST calls from unreal.

TODO:
	perhaps some sort of world chunk streaming system? maybe with generation too.
	console acts buggy with supervisor
	web console would be cool
	admin page would be cool
	planet instances
	spawn players on planets
	simulate planets on server over time
