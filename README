webGL mmorts game in development

current task:
	finish up all the current TODOs in the server rewrite
	unit resource transferring (client and server)

TODO:
	dummy DB interface to allow testing modules in production without actually writing changes
	properly flowtype the entire codebase
	make sure that .save() is rarely used, and make sure that all writes do not clobber
	maybe a distributed locking system for unit movement?
	web console would be cool
	admin page would be cool
	work through TODOs in code and refactor things that I was too lazy to do properly the first time around
	work on documentation
	chat (client and server)
	SSAO lighting effects (client)
	better models (client)
