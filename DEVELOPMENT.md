## Code Quality

- make check should always return valid on master
	- (it's also under heavy development, so this may be not be true..)
- all database calls should use contexts (in progress)
## Atom Configuration

# go

- go-plus
 - go fmt on save

# javascript

- install nuclide for fancy stuff
- give up on using beautifiers, they don't work well with flowtyping
